What I have built in the app is two circuits that are built the same way but one of them has a 5V source while the other has a 6V source.
My observations have told me that the Voltage of the circuit wouldn't change if the circuit was broken, but the Amps did. My observations also told me that the Voltage differs from the
Amps by the Amps being the current force applied and the voltage being the potential force as well as Amps being what "labels the Current." 
Voltage and Amps interact with each other, for example when the Voltage increase so does the number of Amps this also happens when the Voltage is decreased.
